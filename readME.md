# My NVim Config

This is my personal Neovim configuration. I use it for web development and python programming. I used [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) as a base and added some plugins and configurations that I like. I also added some key mappings that I use frequently.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your `~/.config/nvim` directory.
2. Open Neovim and let LazyVim install the plugins.
3. Restart Neovim.

## Plugins

- [LazyVim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
- [Fluoromachine Theme](https://github.com/maxmx03/fluoromachine.nvim)
- [Silicon Screenshots](https://github.com/michaelrommel/nvim-silicon)
- [Toggleterm](https://github.com/akinsho/toggleterm.nvim)

## Key Mappings

* \<jj> - Exit insert mode
* <C-.> - toggle second terminal
* \<leader-S> - Take a screenshot of the current buffer or selection
